                    <p>Contrasting the global 8 per cent decrease in deaths, India recorded a severe 425 per cent increase, along with Thailand (220 per cent) and Indonesia (317 per cent). On December 18, WHO designated JN.1, a sub-lineage of the BA.2.86 Omicron variant, 
                        as a separate Variant of Interest, constituting 27.1 per cent of global sequences in week 48.
                        The report also highlighted a global rise in hospitalizations and ICU admissions, 
                        with India recording over 3,241 new cases and 21 deaths in the 28-day period, 
                        stressing the strain on the healthcare system.
                         As the world shifts from emergency to long-term disease management, WHO emphasized
                         sustained efforts in testing, sequencing, and reporting. WHO called for increased 
                         surveillance and protective measures in response to rising respiratory diseases, 
                         including COVID-19 and the JN.1 sub-variant, urging South-East Asia countries to 
                         take preventive actions.<br>
                         “The COVID-19 virus continues to evolve, change, and circulate in all countries globally. While current evidence suggests the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is low, we must continue to track the evolution of these viruses to tailor our response. For this, countries must strengthen surveillance and sequencing, 
                         and ensure sharing of data,” said Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia. 
                         While JN.1 is currently classified as a variant of interest with a low global public health risk, its
                          rapid spread raises concerns, particularly as countries enter the winter season. Dr. Khetrapal 
                          Singh urged people to take precautions during holiday gatherings, emphasizing the importance of
                           vaccination against COVID-19 and influenza, especially for high-risk individuals.
